# RetailCart

This project is a simple retail application built with Angular 18.

## Installation and Running the App

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd retail-cart
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
   Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to view the app. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Linting and Tests

- **Linting**: Run `ng lint` to execute the linter and ensure code quality.
- **Unit Tests**: Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Incorporate a CI command in your deployment pipeline to set thresholds for code quality. This ensures that the codebase maintains high standards over time and prevents regressions. Consider using tools like [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) or [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automate this process.

## What Next

1. **State Management**: As the application grows, implementing a state management solution like NgRx or Akita will help manage state in a more predictable and scalable way.

2. **The Use of Signals**: Work has already begun on a branch called `signal-based-solution` to incorporate signals, which can enhance reactivity and performance.

3. **Automation Testing**: Consider adding automation testing using tools like Cypress or Selenium to ensure the application functions correctly across different scenarios.

4. **Internalization**: Add support for multiple languages using a library like Transloco to make the application accessible to a wider audience.

5. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to avoid hardcoded values and allow the injection of unique values per environment, such as API URLs.
