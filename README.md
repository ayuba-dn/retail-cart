## Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Linting and Tests

- **Linting**: Run `ng lint` to execute the linter and ensure code quality.
- **Unit Tests**: Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Incorporate a CI command in your deployment pipeline to set thresholds for code quality. This ensures that the codebase maintains high standards over time and prevents regressions. Consider using tools like [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) or [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automate this process.
